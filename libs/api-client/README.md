 # libs
 This folder contains private HopTrip libraries. The libraries are
 installed as `git subtree` and linked via local composer repo.
 
 ## Adding/updating a local dependency
 * Add a corresponding library as a remote. E.g. `git remote add lib-api-client https://github.com/travelsense/lib-api-client`
 * Merge using git subtree: `git subtree add --prefix libs/api-client lib-api-client 1.1.0 --squash`
 * In case of update use `pull` instead of `add`
 * Link the folder in composer.json as a "path" repo
 * Run `composer update`
